/// \class RH_ABZ RH_ABZ.h <RH_ABZ.h>
/// \brief Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via 
/// radio transceiver in a muRata cmwx1zzabz module, which includes an STM32L0 processor,
/// a SX1276 LoRa radio and an antenna switch.
///
/// Requires the Grumpy Old Pizza Arduino Core installed per https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/ArduinoCore-stm32l0
///
/// Works with EcoNode SmartTrap, Tlera Grasshopper and family. Almost any board equipped with a muRata cmwx1zzabz module
/// should work. Tested with EcoNode SmartTrap, Arduino 1.8.9, GrumpyOldPizza Arduino Core for STM32L0.
/// When building for EcoNode SmartTrap in Arduino IDE, select board type Grasshopper-L082CZ.
///
/// \par Overview
///
/// This class is a specialisation of the RH_RF95 class, but with overridden functions to ensure that RH_RF95 communicates
/// with the SX1276 radio on the correct SPI interface (STM32L0_SPI_INSTANCE_SPI1). The class configures the SPI and
/// interfaces with the radio using native stm32l0 calls. It also uses stm32l0 calls to intialise the radio interface pins,
/// antenna interface pins, and to toggle the radio NSS pin for SPI communicaitons. The reason for this speicalisaiton is that
/// all the STM32L0 variants in the Grumpy Pizzas Arduino Core define the Arduino compatible SPI interface and the
/// Arduino compatible IO pins in varying and inconsistent ways. So we use native stm32l0 calls to make _sure_ we get the right
/// pins and interfaces.
///
/// All the comments in the RH_RF95 class concerning modulation, packet formats etc apply equally to this module.
///
/// \par Temperature Controlled Crystal Oscillator (TCXO)
///
/// The muRata cmwx1zzabz module includes a TCXO. Pins to enable the TCXO and to connect to 32MHz output to the radio
/// are exposed on the module. Some boards (Econode SmartTrap for example) permanently power the TCXO and permanenetly
/// connect it to the radio. Other boards (Grasshopper for example) have the TCXO enable connected to a GPIO pin, allowing
/// the TCXO to be controlled by software. Different boards may use different GPIO pins to control the TCXO.
///
/// The SX1276 radio can be configured to use the TCXO, and the Arduino Core defaults the radio to using TCXO.
/// Therefore it is important that you ensure the TCXO is powered up, at least when you want the radio to operate.
/// If the TCXO is not powered, the radio will not work.
///
/// On the Tlera boards supported the Arduino Core, you can call SX1276SetBoardTcxo() to enable or disable the TCXO
/// by controlling the correct pin for your board.
/// By default the core disables TCXO at the end of initialisation, so by the time your sketch starts to run
/// the TCXO is powered off.
/// You will almost certainly need to call
/// \code
/// SX1276SetBoardTcxo(true); 
/// \endcode
/// in your setup() or at other times when you want the radio to operate.
///
/// If you have a board where the TCXO is permanently powered, this is unnecessary.
///
/// \par Connecting and configuring the radio
///
/// There is no special configuration for the SX1276 radio in the  muRata cmwx1zzabz module: the CPU, radio and
/// antenna switch are all hardwired within the module can, and cannot be changed. Initialise the radio like this
/// with the default constructor:
/// \code
///  RH_ABZ driver;
/// \endcode
///
/// \par Range
///
/// We made some primitive range tests with 2 identical EcoNode SmartTrap at 868MHz, 20dBm transmit power with
/// modem config RH_RF95::Bw125Cr45Sf2048, using the abz_client and abz_server sketches included in this distribution.
/// We monitored for reliabilty of 2-way communications (ie how reliably can the client get a reply from the server,
/// which is a 2-way comms that depends on both send and receive. The SmartTrap has a simple small helical antenna.
/// The environment was a beach in a developed area, one node was stationary
/// on a rock about 1m above sand level. The mobile node was handl-held at 1 m above ground level. All measurements were line-of-sight.
