//      This FreeRTOS port "extension" for STM32 uses LPTIM to generate the OS tick instead of the systick
// timer.  The benefit of the LPTIM is that it continues running in "stop" mode as long as its clock source
// does.  A typical clock source for the LPTIM is LSE (or LSI), which does keep running in stop mode.
//
//      The resulting FreeRTOS port:
//
//   o Allows use of low-power stop modes during tickless idle, while still keeping kernel time.
//   o Eliminates kernel-time drift associated with tickless idle in official FreeRTOS port
//   o Eliminates kernel-time drift caused by rounding the OS tick to a whole number of timer counts.
//   o Avoids drift and errors found in other LPTIM implementations available from ST or the public domain.
//   o Detects/reports ticks dropped due to the application masking interrupts (the tick ISR) for too long.
//
//      This software is currently adapted for STM32L4(+) but is easily adaptable to (or already compatible
// with) any STM32 that provides an LPTIM peripheral, such as STM32L, STM32F, STM32G, STM32H, STM32W, and the
// new STM32U.


// Terminology
//
//      "Count" - What a timer does in its "count" register (CNT).
//
//      "Tick" - The OS tick, made up of some number of timer counts.


// Perfect Tick Frequency
//
//      This software optionally varies the number of timer counts per OS tick to achieve the target OS tick
// frequency.  The OS tick generally occurs no more than half a timer count early or half a timer count late
// compared to the ideal tick time.  This is especially useful with a 32768Hz reference on LSE and a desired
// 1000Hz system tick.  In that case, this software uses 32-count and 33-count tick durations as needed to
// stay on the 1000Hz tick schedule.  No matter how you set configLPTIM_REF_CLOCK_HZ and configTICK_RATE_HZ,
// this software stays precisely on schedule.
//
//      You can disable this feature and instead use a simple, constant number of timer counts per OS tick by
// defining configLPTIM_ENABLE_PRECISION to 0.  Your effective tick rate will be as close as possible to
// configTICK_RATE_HZ while using a constant number of counts per tick.  For example, with a 32768 Hz clock
// and an ideal tick frequency of 1000 Hz, the actual tick frequency is ~993 Hz.


// Silicon Bug
//
//      The LPTIM has a silicon bug that can cause the CPU to be temporarily stuck in the LPTIM ISR with no
// way for the CPU to clear the IRQ.  The silicon bug is not documented by ST (yet), but the "stuck" condition
// appears to last one full count of the LPTIM.  It seems to occur only when the application is using the MCU
// "stop" power modes.
//
//      Any attempt to use stop mode in the window between a "match" and the CMPM one count later causes the
// match interrupt to be asserted (early), and it cannot be cleared until the CMPM flag is set.  Additionally,
// any attempt to use stop mode during the timer count after a CMPM event that we tried to suppress too late
// also results in the entire count duration stuck in the ISR.  By "suppress too late", we mean write a new
// value to CMP just before a CMPM event.
//
//      As a workaround, the application should be sure that configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY is a lower priority
// than application interrupts.  We considered a workaround in this file but realized that our only viable
// recourse is to avoid stop mode at strategic times, but those time windows last several timer counts.  Using
// sleep mode instead of stop mode for several counts is more costly than the silicon bug itself, which uses
// run mode instead of stop mode for one timer count (stuck in interrupt handlers).


// Quirks of LPTIM
//
//      The following "quirks" indicate that LPTIM is designed for PWM output control and not for generating
// timed interrupts.  This software overcomes all of them.
//
//   o Writes to CMP are delayed by a sync mechanism inside the timer.  The sync takes ~3 timer counts.
//   o During the synchronization process, additional writes to CMP are prohibited.
//   o CMPOK (sync completion) comes *after* the CMP value is asynchronously available for match events.
//   o The match condition is not simply "CNT == CMP" but is actually "CNT >= CMP && CNT != ARR".
//   o The timer sets CMPM (and optional IRQ) one timer count *after* the match condition is reached.
//   o With a new CMP value, the timer must first be in a "no-match" condition to generate a match event.
//   o Setting CMP == ARR is prohibited.  See below.
//   o Changing IER (interrupt-enable register) is prohibited while LPTIM is enabled.
//   o The CPU can get stuck temporarily in the LPTIM ISR when using stop mode.  See "Silicon Bug" above.
//
//      This software sets ARR to 0xFFFF permanently and modifies CMP to arrange each next tick interrupt.
// Due to the rule against setting CMP == ARR, we never set CMP to 0xFFFF.  If the ideal CMP value for a tick
// interrupt is 0xFFFF, we use 0 instead.


// Side Effects
//
//   o Tick Overhead.  OS ticks generated by this software have more overhead than ticks generated by the
//     official port code.  In most applications, the overhead doesn't make any real difference.  Our tick ISR
//     is longer by a handful of CPU instructions, and we execute a 2nd, very short ISR in between ticks.
//
//   o Tick IRQ Priority.  The tick IRQ priority must be high enough that no combination of ISRs can block its
//     execution for longer than 1 tick.  See configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY (below) for more information.
//     However, the application may safely mask interrupts for longer than 1 tick, rare as that need may be.
//     (One common example is for "fast-programming" flash memory on STM32.)  In that case, this software even
//     reports dropped ticks afterward via traceTICKS_DROPPED().
//
//   o Tick Jitter.  When precision is enabled (configLPTIM_ENABLE_PRECISION), ticks generated by this
//     software have jitter, as described above in "Perfect Tick Frequency".  In most applications, jitter in
//     the tick periods is not a concern.

// application has long ISRs, you may need to increase the priority of the tick.  The tick priority must be
// high enough that no combination of ISRs at or above its priority level can block the tick ISR for longer
// than 1 tick.  But the priority must not be higher than configLIBRARY_MAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY
// (meaning that the value of configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY must not be numerically lower).

// tick duration to a whole number of timer counts.  No matter how you set the precision option, this software
// eliminates the drift normally associated with tickless idle.  The precision option is enabled by default
// because it has a very small footprint by all measures (flash, RAM, execution time).  However, because the
// precision feature requires additional division operations, Cortex M0 users may consider disabling it.  CM0
