//      This FreeRTOS port "extension" for STM32 uses LPTIM to generate the OS tick instead of the systick
// timer.  The benefit of the LPTIM is that it continues running in "stop" mode as long as its clock source
// does.  A typical clock source for the LPTIM is LSE (or LSI), which does keep running in stop mode.
//
//      The resulting FreeRTOS port:
//
//   o Allows use of low-power stop modes during tickless idle.
//   o Eliminates kernel-time drift associated with tickless idle in official FreeRTOS port
//   o Eliminates kernel-time drift caused by rounding the OS tick to a whole number of timer counts.
//   o Avoids drift and errors found in other LPTIM implementations available from ST or the public domain.
//   o Detects/reports ticks dropped due to the application masking interrupts (the tick ISR) for too long.
//   o Is easily adaptable to add ppm steering to correct frequency error in the oscillator (LSE/LSI).
//
//      This software is currently adapted for STM32L4(+) but is easily adaptable to (or already compatible
// with) any STM32 that provides an LPTIM peripheral, including most STM32L models, some STM32F models,
// STM32G, STM32H, and STM32W.


// Terminology
//
//      "Count" - What a timer does in its "count" register (CNT).
//
//      "Tick" - The OS tick, made up of some number of timer counts.


// Perfect Tick Frequency
//
//      This software optionally varies the number of timer counts per OS tick to achieve the target OS tick
// frequency.  The OS tick generally occurs no more than half a timer count early or half a timer count late
// compared to the ideal tick time.  This is especially useful with a 32768Hz reference on LSE and a desired
// 1000Hz system tick.  In that case, this software uses 32-count and 33-count tick durations as needed to
// stay on the 1000Hz tick schedule.  No matter how you set configLPTIM_REF_CLOCK_HZ and configTICK_RATE_HZ,
// this software stays precisely on schedule.
//
//      You can disable this feature and instead use a simple, constant number of timer counts per OS tick by
// defining configLPTIM_ENABLE_PRECISION to 0.  Your effective tick rate will be as close as possible to
// configTICK_RATE_HZ while using a constant number of counts per tick.  For example, with a 32768 Hz clock
// and an ideal tick frequency of 1000 Hz, the actual tick frequency is ~993 Hz.


// Silicon Bug
//
//      The LPTIM has a silicon bug that can cause the CPU to be temporarily stuck in the LPTIM ISR with no
// way for the CPU to clear the IRQ.  The silicon bug is not documented by ST (yet), but the "stuck" condition
// appears to last one full count of the LPTIM.  It seems to occur only when the application is using the MCU
// "stop" power modes.
//
//      Any attempt to use stop mode in the window between a "match" and the CMPM one count later causes the
// match interrupt to be asserted (early), and it cannot be cleared until the CMPM flag is set.  Additionally,
// any attempt to use stop mode during the timer count after a CMPM event that we tried to suppress too late
// also results in the entire count duration stuck in the ISR.  By "suppress too late", we mean write a new
// value to CMP just before a CMPM event.
//
//      As a workaround, the application should be sure that configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY is a lower priority
// than application interrupts.  We considered a workaround in this file but realized that our only viable
// recourse is to avoid stop mode at strategic times, but those time windows last several timer counts.  Using
// sleep mode instead of stop mode for several counts is more costly than the silicon bug itself, which uses
// run mode instead of stop mode for one timer count (stuck in interrupt handlers).


// Quirks of LPTIM
//
//      The following "quirks" indicate that LPTIM is designed for PWM output control and not for generating
// timed interrupts.  This software overcomes all of them.
//
//   o Writes to CMP are delayed by a sync mechanism inside the timer.  The sync takes ~3 timer counts.
//   o During the synchronization process, additional writes to CMP are prohibited.
//   o CMPOK (sync completion) comes *after* the CMP value is asynchronously available for match events.
//   o The match condition is not simply "CNT == CMP" but is actually "CNT >= CMP && CNT != ARR".
//   o The timer sets CMPM (and optional IRQ) one timer count *after* the match condition is reached.
//   o With a new CMP value, the timer must first be in a "no-match" condition to generate a match event.
//   o Setting CMP == ARR is prohibited.  See below.
//   o Changing IER (interrupt-enable register) is prohibited while LPTIM is enabled.
//   o The CPU can get stuck temporarily in the LPTIM ISR when using stop mode.  See "Silicon Bug" above.
//
//      This software sets ARR to 0xFFFF permanently and modifies CMP to arrange each next tick interrupt.
// Due to the rule against setting CMP == ARR, we never set CMP to 0xFFFF.  If the ideal CMP value for a tick
// interrupt is 0xFFFF, we use 0 instead.


// Side Effects
//
//   o Tick Overhead.  OS ticks generated by this software have more overhead than ticks generated by the
//     official port code.  In most applications, the overhead doesn't make any real difference.  Our tick ISR
//     is longer by a handful of CPU instructions, and we execute a 2nd, very short ISR in between ticks.
//
//   o Tick IRQ Priority.  The tick IRQ priority must be high enough that no combination of ISRs can block its
//     execution for longer than 1 tick.  See configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY (below) for more information.
//     However, the application may safely mask interrupts for longer than 1 tick, rare as that need may be.
//     (One common example is for "fast-programming" flash memory on STM32.)  In that case, this software even
//     reports dropped ticks afterward via traceTICKS_DROPPED().
//
//   o Tick Jitter.  When precision is enabled (configLPTIM_ENABLE_PRECISION), ticks generated by this
//     software have jitter, as described above in "Perfect Tick Frequency".  In most applications, jitter in
//     the tick periods is not a concern.

//      Symbol configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY, optionally defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h, controls the tick
// interrupt priority.  Most applications should define configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY to be
// configLIBRARY_LOWEST_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY because the tick doesn't need a high priority.  But if your
// application has long ISRs, you may need to increase the priority of the tick.  The tick priority must be
// high enough that no combination of ISRs at or above its priority level can block the tick ISR for longer
// than 1 tick.  But the priority must not be higher than configLIBRARY_MAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY
// (meaning that the value of configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY must not be numerically lower).
//
//      Be sure to consider the information in "Silicon Bug" above before increasing the interrupt priority of

//      Symbol configLPTIM_ENABLE_PRECISION, optionally defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h, allows a configuration to

// described above in "Perfect Tick Frequency".  The arithmetic corrects for any error in rounding the desired
// tick duration to a whole number of timer counts.  No matter how you set the precision option, this software
// eliminates the drift normally associated with tickless idle.  The precision option is enabled by default
// because it has a very small footprint by all measures (flash, RAM, execution time).  However, because the
// precision feature requires additional division operations, Cortex M0 users may consider disabling it.  CM0
// does not have a native divide instruction, so division operations are a little slow on that platform.

//      If the application masks interrupts (specifically the tick interrupt) long enough to drop a tick, then
// the tick ISR calls this trace macro to report the condition along with the number of ticks dropped.  You
// can define this macro in FreeRTOSConfig.h.  Remember that the macro executes from within the tick ISR.
// Also be aware that the ISR resets the phase of the ticks after calling this macro.
//
//      If ticks are dropped and you did *not* mask the tick interrupt long enough to drop a tick, you
// probably have ISRs blocking the tick ISR for too long.  This is not necessarily a problem, but if you want
// to avoid dropped ticks, or if any combination of ISRs can block the tick ISR for more than a tick period
// even with no masking of interrupts, then you must adjust your design or reconfigure the interrupt
// priorities.  Please see configTICK_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY above.

// LPTIM Instance Selection

That's true for developers relying on the HAL to invoke STOP mode. However, that part of the HAL code is really bloated.
Here's the basic gist of some good clean pre- and post- functions (for STM32L).

This code assumes you always use the same STOP mode (eg, 0, 1, or 2) and have that selection set in PWR->CR1.
And if you care which wake-up clock you use, you must have that selection set in RCC->CFGR.

This code also requires your application code (or your driver code or wrapper etc) to maintain deepSleepPermittedFlags
at all times, perhaps through an application-specific power-management API.
This in turn requires that the developer understand which hardware does and does not function in the STOP mode being used.
