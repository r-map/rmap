 *  MinimalReceiver.cpp
 *
 *  Receives IR protocol data of 1 protocol.
 *  Example with minimal functionality to receive 1 protocol - especially suited for ATtinies.

 *  *****************************************************************************************************************************
 *  To access the library files from your sketch, you have to first use `Sketch/Show Sketch Folder (Ctrl+K)` in the Arduino IDE.
 *  Then navigate to the parallel `libraries` folder and select the library you want to access.
 *  The library files itself are located in the `src` sub-directory.
 *  If you did not yet store the example as your own sketch, then with Ctrl+K you are instantly in the right library folder.
