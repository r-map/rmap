sentence=Control RC Servo motors.
paragraph=PWMServo uses PWM signals for immunity to interrupts, which can corrupt the signals generated by the standard Servo library.  SoftwareSerial, Adafruit_NeoPixel and DmxSimple are the most common cause of these problems.  PWMServo allows use of servo motors when these or other interrupt blocking libraries are required.
