1. use lscpu to determine 32/64 bit machine and big or little endian

2. two libraries are built, a static and a shared dynamic, the test code uses the static library

3. the LLVM 4.0.0 scan-build program is used for static analysis

4. email ricahrd.hogaboom@gmail.com about bugs/caveats/suggestions/observations

5. since bit_offset is unsigned long it cannot have negative values - however no
   check for too large is done

6. in the build script adjust the CC variable to change the compiler - clang/gcc/clang++/g++
