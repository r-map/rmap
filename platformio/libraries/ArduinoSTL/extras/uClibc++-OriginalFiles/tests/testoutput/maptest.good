Start of map test
Checking to make sure that map::iterator can be compared
to map::const_iterator: OK

Adding a few elements...
Elements:
test["b"] = 2 - should be 2
test["a"] = 1 - should be 1
test["k"] = 11 - should be 11
Reasigning the value of a
test["a"] = 65 - should be 65
All of the contents of test:
First element: a: 65
First element: a: 65
a: 65
b: 2
c: 3
k: 11
Elements in reverse order:
k: 11
c: 3
b: 2
a: 65
Number of elements: 4
Container empty? 0
Finding element "c"
Found value for c: 3
Count of elements with key "c": 1
Inserting element g: 
Value inserted? 1
Key: g, value: 6
a: 65
b: 2
c: 3
g: 6
k: 11
Attempting to insert same element again: no insert - PASSED
Erasing element "g"
a: 65
b: 2
c: 3
k: 11
Erasing element "c"
a: 65
b: 2
k: 11
This should read 2: 2
This should read 11: 11
This should read end: end
This should read 2: 2
This should read 11: 11
This should read end: end
This should read 11: 11
test roman numerals
Inserting values now
map_char_myClass['x'] = 20
map_char_myClass['x'] = 10
map_char_myClass['z'] = 0
Here is the bit which is currently non-compliant:
m_2 is two
m_3 is three
m_2 is now two
m_3 is now three
