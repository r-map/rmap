Things TODO.

Write more tests.  Try to test every function with at least two valid and
	one invalid value.  For templates test with at least two primitive
	as well as one class data type.

Replace the IO stream library with an unbuffered version.  This should be
	both easier to maintain as well as result in smaller code.
	Remember that pbackfail and similar functions must work properly
	according to spec.

Change ostream code so that it uses fill/width properly

Clean up the list header - factor out common code of many of the function
	to make everything smaller - maybe

Convert bitset code to a common code-base to factor out code.  This should
	cut down code size at the cost of additional performance overhead.

Clean up istream code so that a lot of the checking for stuff is put into
	the sentry class.


Find out why utilities pair operator= isn't working correctly

slice_array: remove fill(), constify operator=
