For those just beginning with the uClibc++ library, the steps to
begin are fairly easy.

1)  Find the location of the GNU libsupc++.a file on your computer.
    It will likely be in a location like:
    /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.3.4/libsupc++.a
    Make a note of this file path

2)  Run 'make menuconfig' which will bring up a nifty ncurses-based
    configuration dialog system.  This is similar to the Linux kernel
    configuration system, and was ripped directly from uClibc.

3)  Configure to fit your system.  Defaults will be good enough for
    now.

4)  Under 'Library Installation Options', put the path to libsupc++.a
    in the appropriate location.

5)  Save your configuration

6)  Compile by typing 'make'

7)  Install the library by typing 'make install'

8)  If you want to use this library as a part of your working system
    and you did not install the library to a directory in the library
    search path, you can either add the installation directory to
    the /etc/ld.so.conf file, or (preferred) make a symlink from
    the libuClibc++.so symlink into a directory in your search path,
    such as /usr/lib

9)  Compile applications using the wrapper script provided in the bin
    directory of the install path.  If you run into problems, please
    let me know.

10) Enjoy!
