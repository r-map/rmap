Source Files

All of the forward declarations and templates are defined in header files in
the include/ directory.

All of the .cpp files in the src/ directory are supposed to produce binary output
at compile time to be linked into the library.  There is one such file per header
file located in include.  These .cpp files may not actually contain any code or
instanteated objects and instead simply be place holders.

Source categories.

Source code can be broken down into 4 separate categories:

-   uClibc++ support code
	-	new and delete operators

-   GNU libstdc++ support code
	-	Code taken to be compatible with compiler ABI requirements
	-	Difficult to replace

-   IOStream code
	-	This code is used by almost anything.  It is extremely 
		convoluted internally and has been rewritten on more than one
		occasion because it is very difficult to understand

-   STL Containers and Algorithms
	-	These are hardest to keep small because of code expansion.
	-	Fairly self-contained in their own right


Deviations from spec
-	Map and set iterators are currently invalidated if you erase or insert an
	element into the map/set

-	Locales are not supported.  This is intentional.
