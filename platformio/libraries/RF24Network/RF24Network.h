 * @mainpage Network Layer for RF24 Radios
 *
 * This class implements an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer">OSI Network Layer</a> using nRF24L01(+) radios driven
 * by the newly optimized <a href="http://tmrh20.github.com/RF24/">RF24</a> library fork.
 *
 * @section Purpose Purpose/Goal
 *
 * Original: Create an alternative to ZigBee radios for Arduino communication.
 * 
 * New: Enhance the current functionality for maximum efficiency, reliability, and speed
 *
 * Xbees are excellent little radios, backed up by a mature and robust standard
 * protocol stack.  They are also expensive.
 *
 * For many Arduino uses, they seem like overkill.  So I am working to improve the current
 * standard for nRF24L01 radios.  The best RF24 modules are available for less than
 * $6 from many sources.  With the RF24Network layer, I hope to cover many
 * common communication scenarios.
 *
 * Please see the @ref Zigbee page for a comparison against the ZigBee protocols

 * @section Topology Topology for Mesh Networks using nRF24L01(+)
 *
 * This network layer takes advantage of the fundamental capability of the nRF24L01(+) radio to
 * listen actively to up to 6 other radios at once.  The network is arranged in a
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Topology#Tree">Tree Topology</a>, where
 * one node is the base, and all other nodes are children either of that node, or of another.
 * Unlike a true mesh network, multiple nodes are not connected together, so there is only one
 * path to any given node.
 *
 * @section Octal Octal Addressing and Topology
 *
 * Each node must be assigned an 15-bit address by the administrator.  This address exactly
 * describes the position of the node within the tree.  The address is an octal number.  Each
 * digit in the address represents a position in the tree further from the base.
 *
 * @li Node 00 is the base node.
 * @li Nodes 01-05 are nodes whose parent is the base.
 * @li Node 021 is the second child of node 01.
 * @li Node 0321 is the third child of node 021, an so on.
 * @li The largest node address is 05555, so 3,125 nodes are allowed on a single channel.
 * An example topology is shown below, with 5 nodes in direct communication with the master node,
 * and multiple leaf nodes spread out at a distance, using intermediate nodes to reach other nodes.
 *
 *|   |    | 00 |    |    | 00 |    |    |    | Master Node (00)                                    |
 *|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------------------------------------------|
 *|   |    | 01 |    |    | 04 |    |    |    | 1st level children of master (00)                   |
 *|   | 011|    | 021|    |    |014 |    |    | 2nd level children of master. Children of 1st level.|
 *|111|    |    | 121| 221|    |    | 114|    | 3rd level children of master. Children of 2nd level.|
 *|   |    |    |    |1221|    |1114|2114|3114| 4th level children of master. Children of 3rd level.|
 *
 * @section Routing How routing is handled
 *
 * When sending a message using RF24Network::write(), you fill in the header with the logical
 * node address.  The network layer figures out the right path to find that node, and sends
 * it through the system until it gets to the right place.  This works even if the two nodes
 * are far separated, as it will send the message down to the base node, and then back out
 * to the final destination.
 *
 * All of this work is handled by the RF24Network::update() method, so be sure to call it
 * regularly or your network will miss packets.
 *
 * @section Startup Starting up a node
 *
 * When a node starts up, it only has to contact its parent to establish communication.
 * No direct connection to the Base node is needed.  This is useful in situations where
 * relay nodes are being used to bridge the distance to the base, so leaf nodes are out
 * of range of the base.
 *
 * @section Directionality Directionality
 *
 * By default all nodes are always listening, so messages will quickly reach
 * their destination.
 *
 * You may choose to sleep any nodes on the network if using interrupts. This is useful in a
 * case where the nodes are operating on batteries and need to sleep. This greatly decreases
 * the power requirements for a sensor network. The leaf nodes can sleep most of the time,
 * and wake every few minutes to send in a reading. Routing nodes can be triggered to wake up
 * whenever a payload is received See sleepNode() in the class documentation, and RFNetwork_config.h
 * to enable sleep mode.
 *
 *
 * @page Addressing Addressing Format: Understanding Addressing and Topology
 * An overview of addressing in RF24Network
 *
 * @section Overview Overview
 * The nrf24 radio modules typically use a 40-bit address format, requiring 5-bytes of storage space per address, and allowing a wide
 * array of addresses to be utilized. In addition, the radios are limited to direct communication with 6 other nodes while using the 
 * Enhanced-Shock-Burst (ESB) functionality of the radios.  
 *
 * RF24Network uses a simple method of data compression to store the addresses using only 2 bytes, in a format designed to represent the
 * network topology in an intuitive way.
 * See the <a href="Tuning.html"> Topology and Overview</a> page for more info regarding topology.
 *
 * @section Octal_Binary Decimal, Octal and Binary formats
 * 
 * Say we want to designate a logical address to a node, using a tree topology as defined by the manufacturer.
 * In the simplest format, we could assign the first node the address of 1, the second 2 and so on.  
 * Since a single node can only connect to 6 other nodes (1 parent and 5 children) subnets need to be created if using more than 6 nodes.<br>
 * In this case the children of node 1 could simply be designated as 11,21,31,41, and 51<br>
 * Children of node 2 could be designated as 12,22,32,42, and 52  
 * 
 * The above example is exactly how RF24Network manages the addresses, but they are represented in Octal format.
 * 
 * <b>Decimal, Octal and Binary</b>  
 * <table> 
 * <tr bgcolor="#a3b4d7" >
 * <td> Decimal </td> <td> Binary </td><td> Decimal </td> <td> Binary </td><td> Decimal </td> <td> Binary </td>
 * </tr><tr>
 * <td> 1 </td> <td> 00000001 </td><td> 11 </td> <td> 00001011 </td><td> 111 </td> <td> 01101111 </td>
 * </tr><tr bgcolor="#a3b4d7" >
 * <td> Octal </td> <td> Binary </td><td> Octal </td> <td> Binary </td><td> Octal </td> <td> Binary </td>
 * </tr><tr>
 * <td> 1 </td> <td> 00000001 </td><td> 011 </td> <td> 00001001 </td><td> 0111 </td> <td> 1001001 </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 *  
 * Since the numbers 0-7 can be represented in exactly three bits, each digit is represented by exactly 3 bits when viewed in octal format.  
 * This allows a very simple method of managing addresses via masking and bit shifting.  
 *   
 * @section DisplayAddresses Displaying Addresses
 *
 * When using Arduino devices, octal addresses can be printed in the following manner:
 * @code
 * uint16_t address = 0111; 
 * Serial.println(address,OCT);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Printf can also be used, if enabled, or if using linux/RPi
 * @code
 * uint16_t address = 0111;
 * printf("0%o\n",address);
 * @endcode

 *

 *
 * @section General Understanding Radio Communication and Topology
 * When a transmission takes place from one radio module to another, the receiving radio will communicate
 * back to the sender with an acknowledgement (ACK) packet, to indicate success. If the sender does not
 * receive an ACK, the radio automatically engages in a series of timed retries, at set intervals. The 
 * radios use techniques like addressing and numbering of payloads to manage this, but it is all done 
 * automatically by the nrf chip, out of sight from the user.
 *
 * When working over a radio network, some of these automated techniques can actually hinder data transmission to a degree.
 * Retrying failed payloads over and over on a radio network can hinder communication for nearby nodes, or 
 * reduce throughput and errors on routing nodes.
 *
 * Radios in this network are linked by <b>addresses</b> assigned to <b>pipes</b>. Each radio can listen
 * to 6 addresses on 6 pipes, therefore each radio has a parent pipe and 5 child pipes, which are used
 * to form a tree structure. Nodes communicate directly with their parent and children nodes. Any other
 * traffic to or from a node must be routed through the network.
 *
 * @section Topology Topology of RF24Network
 *
 * Anybody who is familiar at all with IP networking should be able to easily understand RF24Network topology. The
 * master node can be seen as the gateway, with up to 4 directly connected nodes. Each of those nodes creates a
 * subnet below it, with up to 4 additional child nodes. The numbering scheme can also be related to IP addresses,
 * for purposes of understanding the topology via subnetting. Nodes can have 5 children if multicast is disabled.
 *
 * Expressing RF24Network addresses in IP format:  
 *
 * As an example, we could designate the master node in theory, as Address 10.10.10.10 <br> 
 * The children nodes of the master would be 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, 10.10.10.3, 10.10.10.4 and 10.10.10.5 <br> 
 * The children nodes of 10.10.10.1 would be 10.10.1.1, 10.10.2.1, 10.10.3.1, 10.10.4.1 and 10.10.5.1 <br> 
 *    
 * In RF24Network, the master is just 00  <br>
 * Children of master are 01,02,03,04,05  <br>
 * Children of 01 are 011,021,031,041,051  <br>
 * 
 * @section Network Routing
 *
 * Routing of traffic is handled invisibly to the user, by the network layer. If the network addresses are
 * assigned in accordance with the physical layout of the network, nodes will route traffic automatically
 * as required. Users simply constuct a header containing the appropriate destination address, and the network
 * will forward it through to the correct node. Individual nodes only route individual fragments, so if using
 * fragmentation, routing nodes do not need it enabled, unless sending or receiving fragmented payloads themselves.
 *
 * If routing data between parent and child nodes (marked by direct links on the topology image above) the network
 * uses built-in acknowledgement and retry functions of the chip to prevent data loss. When payloads are sent to
 * other nodes, they need to be routed. Routing is managed using a combination of built in ACK requests, and
 * software driven network ACKs. This allows all routing nodes to forward data very quickly, with only the final
 * routing node confirming delivery and sending back an
 * acknowledgement.
 *
 * Example: Node 00 sends to node 01. The nodes will use the built in auto-retry and auto-ack functions.<br>
 * Example: Node 00 sends to node 011. Node 00 will send to node 01 as before. Node 01 will forward the message to
 * 011. If delivery was successful, node 01 will also forward a message back to node 00, indicating success.
 *
 * Old Functionality: Node 00 sends to node 011 using auto-ack. Node 00 first sends to 01, 01 acknowledges.
 * Node 01 forwards the payload to 011 using auto-ack. If the payload fails between 01 and 011, node 00 has
 * no way of knowing. 
 * 
 * @note When retrying failed payloads that have been routed, there is a chance of duplicate payloads if the network-ack
 * is not successful. In this case, it is left up to the user to manage retries and filtering of duplicate payloads.
 *
 * Acknowledgements can and should be managed by the application or user. If requesting a response from another node,
 * an acknowledgement is not required, so a user defined type of 0-64 should be used, to prevent the network from
 * responding with an acknowledgement. If not requesting a response, and wanting to know if the payload was successful
 * or not, users can utilize header types 65-127.
 * 
 * @section TuningOverview Tuning Overview
 * The RF24 radio modules are generally only capable of either sending or receiving data at any given
 * time, but have built-in auto-retry mechanisms to prevent the loss of data. These values are adjusted
 * automatically by the library on startup, but can be further adjusted to reduce data loss, and
 * thus increase throughput of the network. This page is intended to provide a general overview of its
 * operation within the context of the network library, and provide guidance for adjusting these values.
 *
 * @section RetryTiming Auto-Retry Timing
 *
 * The core radio library provides the functionality of adjusting the internal auto-retry interval of the
 * radio modules. In the network configuration, the radios can be set to automatically retry failed
 * transmissions at intervals ranging anywhere from 500us (.5ms) up to 4000us (4ms). When operating any
 * number of radios larger than two, it is important to stagger the assigned intervals, to prevent the
 * radios from interfering with each other at the radio frequency (RF) layer.
 *
 * The library should provide fairly good working values, as it simply staggers the assigned values within
 * groups of radios in direct communication. This value can be set manually by calling radio.setRetries(X,15);
 * and adjusting the value of X from 1 to 15 (steps of 250us).
 *
 * @section AutoRetry Auto-Retry Count and Extended Timeouts
 *
 * The core radio library also provides the ability to adjust the internal auto-retry count of the radio
 * modules. The default setting is 15 automatic retries per payload, and can be extended by configuring
 * the network.txTimeout variable. This default retry count should generally be left at 15, as per the
 * example in the above section. An interval/retry setting of (15,15) will provide 15 retrys at intervals of
 * 4ms, taking up to 60ms per payload. The library now provides staggered timeout periods by default, but
 * they can also be adjusted on a per-node basis.
 *
 * The txTimeout variable is used to extend the retry count to a defined duration in milliseconds. See the
 * network.txTimeout variable. Timeout periods of extended duration (500+) will generally not help when payloads
 * are failing due to data collisions, it will only extend the duration of the errors. Extended duration timeouts
 * should generally only be configured on leaf nodes that do not receive data, or on a dual-headed node.
 *
 * @section Examples
 *
 * <b>Example 1:</b> Network with master node and three leaf nodes that send data to the master node. None of the leaf
 * nodes need to receive data.
 *
 * a: Master node uses default configuration<br>
 * b: Leaf nodes can be configured with extended timeout periods to ensure reception by the master.<br>
 * c:
 * @code
 * Leaf 01: network.txTimeout = 500;   Leaf 02: network.txTimeout = 573;  Leaf 03: network.txTimeout = 653;
 * @endcode
 * This configuration will provide a reduction in errors, as the timeouts have been extended, and are staggered
 * between devices.
 *
 *
 * <b>Example 2:</b> Network with master node and three leaf nodes that send data to the master node. The second leaf
 * node needs to receive configuration data from the master at set intervals of 1 second, and send data back to the
 * master node. The other leaf nodes will send basic sensor information every few seconds, and a few dropped payloads
 * will not affect the operation greatly.
 *
 * a: Master node configured with extended timeouts of .5 seconds, and increased retry delay:
 *   @code
 * 		radio.setRetries(11,15);
 * 		network.txTimeout = 500;
 * 	 @endcode
 * b: Second leaf node configured with a similar timeout period and retry delay:
 * @code
 * 		radio.setRetries(8,15);
 * 		network.txTimeout = 553;
 * @endcode
 * c: First and third leaf nodes configured with default timeout periods or slightly increased timout periods.
 *
 * @section DualHead Dual Headed Operation
 *
 * The library now supports a dual radio configuration to further enhance network performance, while reducing errors on
 * busy networks. Master nodes or relay nodes with a large number of child nodes can benefit somewhat from a dual headed
 * configuration, since one radio is used for receiving, and the other entirely for transmission.
 *
 * To configure a dual headed node:
 * 1. Edit the RF24Network_config.h file, and uncomment #define DUAL_HEAD_RADIO
 * 2. Connect another radio, using the same MOSI, MISO, and SCK lines.
 * 3. Choose another two pins to use for CE and CS on the second radio. Connect them.
 * 4. Setup the radio and network like so:
 *
 * @code
 * 	RF24 radio(7,8);  			// Using CE (7) and CS (8) for first radio
 * 	RF24 radio1(4,5); 			// Using CE (4) and CS (5) for second radio
 * 	RF24Network network(radio,radio1);	// Set up the network using both radios
 *
 *  Then in setup(), call radio.begin(); and radio1.begin(); before network.begin();
 * @endcode
 *
 * 5. Upload to MCU. The node will now use the first radio to receive data, and radio1 to transmit, preventing data loss on a busy network.
 * 6. Re-comment the #define in the config file as required if configuring other single-headed radios.
 *
 *
 * Any node can be configured in dual-head mode.

 * @page Zigbee Comparison to ZigBee
 *
 * This network layer is influenced by the design of ZigBee, but does not implement it
 * directly.
 *
 * @section Advantage Which is better?
 *
 * ZigBee is a much more robust, feature-rich set of protocols, with many different vendors
 * providing compatible chips.
 *
 * RF24Network is cheap.  While ZigBee radios are well over $20, nRF24L01 modules can be found
 * for under $2.  My personal favorite is
 * <a href="http://www.mdfly.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=82">MDFly RF-IS2401</a>.
 *
 * @section Contrast Similiarities & Differences
 *
 * Here are some comparisons between RF24Network and ZigBee.
 *
 * @li Both networks support Star and Tree topologies.  Only Zigbee supports a true mesh.
 * @li In ZigBee networks, only leaf nodes can sleep
 * @li ZigBee nodes are configured using AT commands, or a separate Windows application.
 * RF24 nodes are configured by recompiliing the firmware or writing to EEPROM.
 *
 * @section NodeNames Node Naming
 *
 * @li Leaf node: A node at the outer edge of the network with no children.  ZigBee calls it
 * an End Device node.
 * @li Relay node: A node which has both parents and children, and relays messages from one
 * to the other.  ZigBee calls it a Router.
 * @li Base node.  The top of the tree node with no parents, only children.  Typically this node
 * will bridge to another kind of network like Ethernet.  ZigBee calls it a Co-ordinator node.
